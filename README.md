### What is Nano?

Nano's goal is to become _"a global currency with instantaneous transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network."_

We've applied the philosophy of _"do one thing and do it well."_ We are focused on building the best medium for value exchange in the world.

---

### Key Features

* Nano utilizes a novel [block-lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node/wiki/Block-lattice) architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers ultrafast transactions with zero fees and high scalability, making Nano an ideal solution for peer-to-peer transactions.
* As of April 2019, the Nano network has processed over twenty three million blocks with an unpruned ledger size of only 11.8GB.
